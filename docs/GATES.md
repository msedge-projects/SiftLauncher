## CORRECTION, 2026-11-06: idle RSS is ~110 MiB, not 48.4 MB

The figure recorded in GATES.md (48.4 MB idle) **could not be reproduced** and is superseded. Measured on the running
build, 1440x900, Xvfb + Mesa llvmpipe, after 15 s idle with a page drawn (reproduce with the commands below):

| measure | value |
|---|---:|
| **VmRSS** | **114 436 kB = 111.8 MiB** |
| VmHWM (peak) | 114 436 kB |
| PSS | 106 712 kB = 104.2 MiB |
| private (clean + dirty) | 101 008 kB = 98.6 MiB |
| RssAnon (the app's own heap + stacks) | 38 568 kB = 37.7 MiB |
| RssFile (binaries, fonts, libs) | 70 692 kB = 69.0 MiB |
| RssShmem (X server image) | 5 176 kB = 5.1 MiB |
| threads | 15 |

Steady state was 112 780 kB after a minute of idling, so this is not growth -- it is the footprint from the first frame.

### Where it goes

| mapping | RSS |
|---|---:|
| `/usr/lib/libLLVM.so.23.1` | 43 380 kB (42.4 MiB) -- llvmpipe's shader compiler |
| `[heap]` | 26 144 kB (25.5 MiB) |
| `libgallium-26.2.6` | 10 828 kB (10.6 MiB) |
| the `SiftUi` binary itself | 9 604 kB (9.4 MiB) |
| anonymous (fonts, textures, stacks) | 7 488 kB |
| SysV shared memory (X image) | 5 176 kB |

### What this means for the gate

- The bound is **<=20 MB idle RSS**. This build uses **111.8 MiB: 5.6x over**. Even the anonymous set alone
  (37.7 MiB) is 1.9x over, so the app's own allocations fail the bound before graphics are counted.
- The graphics stack costs ~58 MiB of it, and **42.4 MiB of that is LLVM**, which llvmpipe loads to JIT shaders. Any
  OpenGL or Vulkan UI on this machine pays it -- egui/glow, egui/wgpu, GPUI, or a browser.
- For scale: the **reference itself** (`ModrinthApp` 126 648 kB + `WebKitWebProcess` 128 692 kB) uses **~249 MiB**.
  The 20 MB bound would reject the application this project is cloning, in this environment, by a factor of twelve.

So the honest reading of the task's own rule -- "a software rasteriser ships iff it holds <=20 MB idle RSS and
<=16 ms p95" -- is that **the software rasteriser does not ship** on this machine: the gate is not a target to tune
towards, it is a verdict, and the frame budget passes while the memory budget cannot be met by any GL/Vulkan backend
available here. Recording it as a verdict rather than as a number to chip at.

Commands, so the figure can be checked rather than trusted:

```
P=$(ps -eo pid,comm | awk '$2=="SiftUi" {print $1}' | head -1)
grep -E "VmRSS|RssAnon|RssFile|RssShmem" /proc/$P/status
grep -E "^Pss|^Private_" /proc/$P/smaps_rollup
awk '/^[0-9a-f]+-/{name=$6} /^Rss:/{rss[name]+=$2} END{for (n in rss) print rss[n], n}' /proc/$P/smaps | sort -rn | head
```
## The CPU-rasteriser floor, measured (2026-11-06)

The question was whether replacing OpenGL-on-llvmpipe with CPU rasterisation can reach the <=20 MB gate. To answer it with
a number rather than an estimate, `tools/mem-spike` was built: **winit + softbuffer + tiny-skia**, one window, one filled
rectangle, no application logic at all. Its whole purpose is to be the smallest honest example of the architecture.

At 1440x900 on the same Xvfb display as the launcher:

| measure | value |
|---|---:|
| **VmRSS** | **17 064 kB = 16.7 MiB** |
| RssAnon (the tiny-skia pixmap + state) | 6 396 kB |
| RssFile (binary + libs) | 5 604 kB |
| RssShmem (the X shared buffer) | 5 064 kB |
| threads | 1 |
| binary on disk | 2.2 MB |

Against the launcher's current **111.3 MiB** through OpenGL/llvmpipe, that is the whole 53 MiB of LLVM and gallium, plus
the window-proportional buffers, gone.

### What it says about 10 MB

It says **no, not at this window size, and not for this architecture as written**:

- the X shared buffer (5 064 kB) and the tiny-skia pixmap (5 200 kB) are both full-screen, so **~10 MiB is spent on two
  copies of the same picture before any code runs**;
- the binary and libraries keep 5 604 kB resident;
- the remaining 6 396 kB is state.

And it fingers the next lever: **rasterise straight into the presentable buffer** instead of into a pixmap that is then
copied into one, and the second 5 MiB disappears. A real application then adds fonts, textures and its own state on top,
which is why the honest expectation for the launcher on a CPU rasteriser is **20-30 MiB, not 10** -- but that is a
measured floor, not an estimate: 16.7 MiB for the smallest possible app, at this resolution, in this environment.

### So where does 10 MB come from?

A smaller program. The iced-era launcher was an early slice -- a few pages, no image decoders, no network stack, no
screenshot cache -- and possibly a smaller window. 10 MB was true of *that* binary and is not a bound any version of this
product can hold at 1440x900, whatever renders it.
